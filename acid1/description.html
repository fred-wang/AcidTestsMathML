  <h1>The MathML Acid1 test (description)</h1>

  <p>The MathML Acid1 test contains 7 mathematical expressions that should
    render more or less as follows:</p>

  <p>The basic requirements to pass the tests are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In general, text is layout linearly from left to right
      with normal style (i.e. not italic), modulo the exception below.</li>
    <li>All characters should be displayed properly, including
      greek, fraktur and script letters.</li>
    <li>In test 1, "16" should be rendered as a subscript.</li>
    <li>In test 2, 4 and 7, "old" should be rendered as an underscript.</li>
    <li>In test 6 and 7 "sing to me," should be rendered as an overscript.</li>
    <li>In test 7 "bar" should be rendered as an overscript.</li>
    <li>In test 4, 80/120 and 2/3 should be rendered as fractions with
      numerator above denominator and horizontal fraction bar aligned with the
      equation axis.</li>
    <li>In test 5, "2" should be rendered as a superscript.</li>
    <li>In test 6, "square root of 44000" should be rendered as a radical
      symbol covering the "44000".</li>
    <li>In test 7, elements "the way", "the world ends" etc should be layout as
      a table with 2 rows and 3 columns, vertically centered with respect to
      the equation axis.</li>
    <li>The greek letters should be italic.
      Note that the fraktur h and script A are supposed to be invariant to
      style change, most fonts render the latter slanted.
    </li>
    <li>The parentheses should stretch to become at least as tall as their
      content and should render symmetrically with respect to the equation
      axis.</li>
    <li>The spacing around the operators, namely invisible function application
      U+2061, parenthesis, braces, plus and equal signs,
      should be "reasonable" in
      some sense (neither too small nor excessively large). These operators
      should also be correctly aligned  with respect to the equation axis.
    </li>
  </ol>
